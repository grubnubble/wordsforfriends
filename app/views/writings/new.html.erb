<% if current_user %>

  <p>You are logged in as <%= current_user.username %>. <%= link_to 'Log out.', logout_path %></p>
<% else %>
  <% # anonymous %>
  <p>
    You are currently not logged in, but that shouldn't stop you from creating
    a writing!
  <p>
    Do note, however, that if you save this writing anonymously, you won't be
    able to edit it later on, and your writing will be world viewable.  
    You can also <%= link_to 'log in', login_path %> if you like.
  </p>
<% end %>

<%= render 'form' %>
